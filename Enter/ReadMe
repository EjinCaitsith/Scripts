Script used to enter VERY DIFFICULT HTMB BCNMs. This one is specifically used for Ouryu VD but can be used for all other VD BCs.

Due to Ouryu having a much longer wait, you can adjust the 15 and 25 second waits if doing other BCs to something much lower.

Install Guide:
1) Make a new text file in your script folder named Enter and copy/paste the contents of Enter1 and save. You must edit in your own char names.
2) Make a 2nd new text file and name it Enter2 and copy/paste the contents of Enter2 and save.
3) Make a 3rd new text file and name it Enter3 and copy/paste the contents of Enter3 and save.
4) In game, type //exec enter on your main char while it and all your mules are face the entry point.


WILL NOT WORK IF:

1) You are not facing the entry point for the HTMB
2) You have any options other than the HTMB BC in the menu list
3) You touch your keyboard at any point when the script is running
4) You lag while the script is going
