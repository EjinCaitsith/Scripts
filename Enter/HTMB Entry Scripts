Script used to enter HTMB BCNMs. This one is specifically used for Ouryu but can be used for all others.

Due to Ouryu having a much longer wait, you can adjust the 15 and 25 second waits if doing other BCs to something much lower.

You must edit in your own character names in the Enter1 file.

WILL NOT WORK IF:

1) You have any options other than the HTMB BC in the menu list
2) You touch your keyboard at any point when the script is running
3) You lag while the script is going
