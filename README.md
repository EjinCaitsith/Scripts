Window 4 Buff Scripts

A universally compatible method for doing exactly what GearSwap Commands do, like BRD, WHM, GEO, RDM pre-buffing, regardless of who
the author of your GearSwap is.

All of these Scripts are tuned for my characters based on their merits, gear and buffs. Fine-tuning of the delays may be requiped based on your Fast Cast and other factors. You will also have to edit in your own character names.
